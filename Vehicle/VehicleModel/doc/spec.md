**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).

## Examples

### Normalized Example

Normalized NGSI response

```json
{
    "id": "vehiclemodel:econic",
    "type": "VehicleModel",
    "name": {
        "value": "MBenz-Econic2014"
    },

```

### key-value pairs Example

Sample uses simplified representation for data consumers `?options=keyValues`
