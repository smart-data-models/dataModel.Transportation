Road segments can include several lanes. This data model allows to convey road segments made up of heterogeneous lanes (different in their usage, speed, height, etc.). Lanes are identified by using integer numbers between 1 and n, being number 1 the lane to the right when going forwards. The forward direction is the direction denoted by the vector which goes from the segment"s start point to the segment"s end point. This is the same convention as the one used by OpenStreetMap. This entity is primarily associated with the Automotive and Smart City vertical segments and related IoT applications. This data model has been developed in cooperation with mobile operators and the GSMA.
