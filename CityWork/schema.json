It contains a geographic representation making it possible to locate its work from a specific JSON Object and at a more global level (Road segment, Road, District, ...) in order to assess the potential impacts on the circulation. A GeoJSON object may represent a region of space (a Geometry), a spatially-bounded entity (a Feature), or a list of features (a Feature Collection). refer to the document [geojson](https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-ietf-geojson-03.pdf) for more information about the modeling and the possible value.",
