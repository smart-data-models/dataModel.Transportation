## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `contactPoint`: The details to contact with the item.  - `contractingAuthority`: Name of the contracting authority.  - `contractingCompany`: Name of the contracting company responsible for the exploitation of the station.  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateLastReported`: A timestamp which denotes the last time when the device successfully reported data. Date and time in an ISO8601 UTCformat.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `dimension`: Global dimension. The format is structured by a sub-property of 3 items. The unit code (text) is given using the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/UN/CEFACT_Common_Codes). For instance, **MTR** represents Meters  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `installationMode`: Location  relative to the ground reference. Enum:'aerial, ground, underGround, underSea'  - `inventory`: General data mapping only for `locationType` = 0, 1, 3, 4. The format is structured by a sub-property of 4 items.  - `levelId`: Floor on which the location is located. Numerical index associated with the floor. Indicates the relative position of this stage in relation to the others. The index 0 indicates the ground floor. The floors above ground level are indicated by positive indices, and the underground stages by negative indices.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `locationType`: Link to the GTFS standard repository describing the different location [Location Type]. 0 Stop or platform (place where users get on or off in a public transport vehicle). 1 Station (area or physical structure comprising one or more platforms). 2 Entrance or Exit (place where users can enter / exit a station from the street). 3 Generic intersection (location in a station that doesn't correspond to any other `location_type` value). 4 Boarding area of a specific location on a platform where users can get on / off in a vehicle.  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `openingHoursSpecification`: A structured value providing information about the opening hours of a place or a certain service inside a place  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `parentStation`: Link to the GTFS standard repository describing the different link between Station and Platform [Parent STATION]. Case '1' location_type = 0 (Stop / platform ), the parent_station field contains the ID of a station. Case '2' location_type = 1  (Station), this field must be empty. Case '3' location_type = 2 (Input / output) or location_type = 3 (generic intersection), the parent_station field contains the ID of a station location_type = 1. Case '4' location_type = 4 (boarding area), the parent_station field contains the ID of a platform.  - `platformCode`: Platform identifier for a platform type stop `location_type` = 0 when the stop is in a station.  - `refPointOfInterest`: A reference to a point of interest associated to this observation.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `stationConnected`: Connections possible from this station. A structured value from 0 to N occurrences where each items is a string in the format `stationType` : [List of Lines connected, separated by a comma]. Enum:'aerialLift, bus, cableTram, ferry, funicular, monorail, rail, subway, train, tram, trolleybus'  - `stationType`: Type of transport station. Enum:'aerialLift, bus, cableTram, ferry, funicular, monorail, rail, subway, trolleybus, tram'  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be TransportStation  - `webSite`: Link to the official website for more information..  - `wheelChairAccessible`: Access possible for Person with Reduced Mobility. For stops without parents 0 no information is available regarding the accessibility of the stop. 1 some vehicles at this stop can board a PMR user. 2 PRM user cannot board  at this stop. For a stop that is part of a station 0 the stop inherits the wheelchair_boarding behavior of the parent station, if it is filled in. 1 lanes provide wheelchair access to the stop / platform  from outside the station. 2 no lane provides wheelchair access to the stop / platform from outside the station. For station inputs / outputs 0 the station entry inherits the wheelchair_boarding behavior of the main station, if specified. 1 the station entrance is wheelchair accessible. 2 no wheelchair accessible route connects the station entrance to the stops / platforms.  - `zoneId`: Pricing zone of the station.
