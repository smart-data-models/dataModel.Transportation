## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `endedAt`: The end date and time of the event when the event or operation is known to be over/complete. Null/omitted if not yet ended.  - `fleetVehicle`: Reference to the FleetVehicle entity to which this operation relates.  - `fleetVehicleOperation`: Reference to the FleetVehicleOperation entity to which this status entity relates.  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `initiatingLocation`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `operationType`: The free text type of the event or operation e.g. e.g. Call for a patient transportation, postal collection, delivery, close to a restricted area, overspeed.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `responseTime`: Indicates the time to respond to an event, in seconds. The associated observedAt timestamp indicates when the last update was recorded. E.g. records the response time for an ambulance to reach to a patient  - `result`: The final result of the event or operation.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `startedAt`: The start date and time when the event or operation was triggered.  - `transportTime`: Indicates the time that the fleet vehicle has spent transporting people or supplies for the current operation. E.g. indicates the time an ambulance spent transporting a patient to a hospital emergency department.  - `type`: NGSI Entity identifier. It has to be FleetVehicleOperation
