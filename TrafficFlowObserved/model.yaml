       The date and time of this observation in ISO8601 UTC format. It can be represented by an specific time instant or by an ISO8601 interval.
       As a workaround for the lack of support of Orion Context Broker for datetime intervals, it can be used two separate attributes:
       dateObservedFrom, dateObservedTo.
    dateObservedFrom:

        Usual direction of travel in the lane referred by this observation. 
        This attribute is useful when the observation is not referencing any road segment, 
        allowing to know the direction of travel of the traffic flow observed.
